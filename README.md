HTTPS is the pervasibe standard for all websites, regardless of size or field. 
The Mozilla foundation has gone so far as to [announce their intent to completely phase out HTTP](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/). 
Unfortunately, the procurement, maintenance, and renewal of SSL/TLS certificates has been an expensive and manual process for many.

Enter [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority. Shortly after its release, Simon J.K. Pedersen created the [letsencrypt-siteextension](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension) Azure Web App extension for easy integration with Azure Web Apps. However, at the time of writing it suffers from several issues:

- The extension has to be installed on the same web app as your site.
  - This means you must install the extension on each and every Web App you own.
  - Worse, if you happen to publish your Web App with the "Delete Existing files", it will silently delete the webjob created by the extension, effectively nullifying it.
- There are no e-mail notifications (you could set some basic ones with Zapier but they won't contain details on the actual renewals that took place).
- It relies on an Azure Storage account which has to be [configured in a certain way](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/issues/148), which is an unneeded possible point of failure.
